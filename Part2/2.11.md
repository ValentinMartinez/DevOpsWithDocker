In this exercise, I created a simple API in NodeJS with a containerized development enviroment.

I used two containers: one for the app and another for the database. Also, I used two volumes: one for node_modules and another for the database.

For the app container, I defined the MongoDB URI of our database as an environment variable .

For the database container, I defined the username and password of the database as enviroment variables.

We can easily modify the functionality when the environment is running, as nodemon is going to restart the app with every change made in the source code.

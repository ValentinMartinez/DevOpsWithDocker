The commands used to build and run the project are:

```
docker build . -t "imagebuilder"
docker-compose up
```

Environment variables should be setted up in docker-compose.yml file.

I had no idea how to make the bash script to build an image and push it to Docker Hub with Docker socket, even worse, I've never done a "complex" bash script before.

So to complete the exercise, I had to resort to various sources. I searched in the web and found the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/), some bash scripts to make request to web APIs, and the very useful solution from pimpbot ([link](https://github.com/pimpbot9000/devOpsWithDocker/blob/master/part3/exercise3_2/script.sh)).

To test this project, I used one of the [example projects](https://github.com/docker-hy/ml-kurkkumopo-frontend.git). The link to the published image is [this](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vmmtt/test).

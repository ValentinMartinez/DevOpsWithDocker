I used a supersimple application for this exercise [(App repo)](https://github.com/ValentinMartinez/random-number). This app is a small API made with NodeJS and Express in JavaScript, so the source code isn't compiled or minified. No development dependency was used. 

Then, to reduce the image size, I changed the base image (node:14) to node:14-alpine. Also, I added a non-root user.

In the end, the changes in the Dockerfile were minimal, but the size difference between the two images is very noticeable: the first image is 947MB in size, while the new image is 120MB.

In this 3.07 folder I included the previous Dockerfile and the optimized Dockerfile (Dockerfile.alpine).

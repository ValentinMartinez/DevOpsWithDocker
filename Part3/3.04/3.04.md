To build the original images for frontend and backend, I used node and go images as base images. The initial size for frontend and backend images were:

```
frontend                1.17GB
backend                 1.07GB
```

So, I changed that and used Ubuntu 18.04 image as base image now. The new sizes are:

```
frontend                493MB
backend                 254MB
```

The Dockerfile for each image are included in this folder.

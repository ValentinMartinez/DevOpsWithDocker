Using node:14 as base image for frontend, and golang:1.16 as base image for backend:

```
backend                 latest               1.07GB
frontend                latest               1.17GB
```

Using ubuntu:18.04 as base image for frontend and backend:

```
backend                 latest               254MB
frontend                latest               493MB
```

Using node:14-alpine as base image for frontend, and golang:1.16.12-alpine as base image for backend:

```
backend                 1.16.12-alpine       447MB
frontend                14-alpine            344MB
```

The backend image using ubuntu:18.04 is smaller than the one using golang:1.16.12-alpine because in the first I removed go after building the binary.
